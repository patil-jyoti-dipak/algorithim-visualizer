## Features

- Visualizes Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

- Visualizes Searching Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- Adjustable animation speed
- Dynamic random array generation
- Step-by-step explanation panel
- Interactive and responsive dark-themed UI

---

## How It Works

The application generates a random array and visually demonstrates algorithm execution by dynamically updating DOM elements. CSS-based animations are applied to represent comparisons, swaps, sorted states, and search operations in real time.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages (Deployment)

## Algorithms Covered

### Sorting
- Bubble Sort — O(n²)
- Selection Sort — O(n²)
- Insertion Sort — O(n²)

### Searching
- Linear Search — O(n)
- Binary Search — O(log n)

---

## Purpose

This project is designed to strengthen understanding of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms concepts through visual learning and interactive experimentation.
